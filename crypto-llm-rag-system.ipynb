      " A VC Focussed Prompt refers to a strategy or approach used by venture capital firms to select investments based on certain criteria or preferences. This could include factors such as the potential for growth, market size, competitive advantage, and alignment with the firm's investment goals. The term \"VC Focused\" suggests that this approach is specifically tailored towards venture capital activities.\n",

      "An example of a VC focused prompt might be selecting investments based solely on their potential for rapid growth and strong market traction. This type of prompt would likely involve analyzing various metrics related to startup success rates, revenue projections, customer acquisition costs, and exit strategies. By focusing on these key indicators, venture capitalists can identify promising startups that align well with their investment objectives, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful exits and overall portfolio performance. In essence, a VC-focused prompt aims to streamline the selection process by prioritizing companies that show early signs of substantial growth and profitability, making them more attractive targets for investment.

They serve as essential components for utilizing these networks, enabling the execution of digital contracts, and serving as collateral. The classification of Infracoins into two main categories—Blockchain 2.x (such as Ethereum) and other Blockchain 1.0 alternatives or competitors like Cardano or Polkadot—is based on their role within expanding blockchain technology beyond Bitcoin's scope. This categorization reflects the effort to broaden the application of blockchain technology across different sectors and industries.

      " The complexity of making financial decisions can be understood by examining how much computational effort they require. This concept has gained recognition as a significant factor affecting sound financial decision-making. However, there isn't a current theoretical framework specifically designed to characterize this complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our study, we developed a framework to quantify the complexity involved in financial decisions through their computational demands. Applying this framework to binary choices like whether to use a credit card, we found that complexity plays a crucial role in these decisions. Specifically, we observed that people tend to make errors more frequently when faced with complex options compared to simpler ones. Interestingly, we discovered that the burden of complexity is particularly heavy on individuals who carry balances on their cards, which means they face higher stakes due to potential interest charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our findings indicate that while attention and financial literacy might influence decisions, they do not fully explain why some people make mistakes more often. Instead, the essence of complexity appears to be driving these errors. Therefore, understanding and managing the complexities associated with financial decisions could significantly improve outcomes for both consumers and businesses alike. [Doc:FDCP.pdf |Page:7]\n",

The primary goal was to create a decentralized digital currency system that could operate independently of traditional financial institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Blockchains 2.x**: Emerging after the first wave, these blockchains aimed at addressing the limitations of Blockchains 1 by improving scalability, transaction speed, and interoperability. Innovations like Proof-of-Stake (PoS), sharding, and Layer 2 solutions were introduced to enhance efficiency and reduce congestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A new phase known as **Blockchain Technology 3** is currently underway. This phase represents a paradigm shift towards more complex, interconnected systems where data sharing becomes central. Technologies such as smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and federated networks are driving innovation in this domain, aiming for greater autonomy and control over user data and transactions across different platforms.\n",
