      " A VC Focussed Prompt refers to a strategy or model designed specifically for venture capital firms. It involves generating investment decisions based on factors unique to this industry, such as the need for early-stage funding, the importance of network effects, and the potential for rapid growth. This approach aims to capture the specific dynamics and opportunities within the venture capital sector.\n",

      "An example of a VC focused prompt could be one that prioritizes investments in startups with strong networks, particularly those operating in technology sectors. Such a prompt might consider metrics like the number of connections between founders and key stakeholders, the size of the team, and past success rates among similar ventures. The goal would be to identify companies that have the best chance of achieving significant market impact through their innovative products or services, even if they lack substantial financial backing at the outset. This type of prompt would likely involve rigorous due diligence to ensure that the selected projects align with the firm's strategic goals and long-term vision. By focusing on these criteria, the venture capitalist can make more informed and potentially more successful investments compared to broader market strategies. [Doc:LVMH Ventures.pdf |Page:8]\n",

      " The complexity of making financial decisions has been identified as a significant barrier to effective financial management. This concept is crucial because it highlights how various factors can complicate the process of managing money, leading to potential errors and misjudgments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed framework by Lee et al. (2019) offers a method to quantify this complexity, focusing specifically on computational demands rather than other common barriers like inattention due to cognitive overload or limited financial knowledge. By applying this framework to binary choice scenarios such as whether to use a credit card, they demonstrate that complexity plays a pivotal role in these decisions.\n",

      "Their research indicates that complexity influences behavior more profoundly among individuals with high stakes involved in their financial decisions. Specifically, those carrying balances face greater challenges due to higher risk exposure when making credit card usage decisions. These findings underscore the importance of understanding and addressing the complexities inherent in financial transactions to ensure sound financial practices.\n",

      "- **Blockchain 1.x**: This version typically represents early blockchain implementations without smart contracts. It was primarily focused on peer-to-peer networks for secure transactions but lacked advanced features like decentralized applications (dApps), consensus mechanisms, and complex functionalities.\n",

      "- **Blockchains 2.x**: These blockchains incorporate more sophisticated technologies such as smart contracts, improved scalability solutions, and enhanced security protocols. They support dApps, enabling developers to build complex applications on top of the blockchain infrastructure. Examples include Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Corda.\n",
